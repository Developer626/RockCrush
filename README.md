Rock Crusher is a match-three game for Pebble where you swap neighbouring rocks to get at least three of the same type in a row. The game ends when you have used all your lives and there are no valid moves left on the board.
 
## Controls:
  * Move the cursor with the *RIGHT* and *DOWN* buttons, or *TILT* your wrist.
  * Enter _SWAP_ mode by pressing the *UP* button.
  * In _SWAP_ mode, choose the direction to swap with the *UP*, *DOWN*, *LEFT* or *RIGHT* button, or *TILT* your wrist.
  * When not in _SWAP_ mode, press the *LEFT* button to save and exit.

## Specials:
  * Match four rocks in a row to make a Pearl, which can match any colour of rock.
  * Match a rock in two directions to make Black Powder - careful, it's explosive.
  * Match five rocks in a row to blast that rock type.
