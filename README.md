Rock Crusher is a match-three game for Pebble where you swap neighbouring rocks to get at least three of the same type in a row. The game ends when you have used all your lives and there are no valid moves left on the board.
 
## Controls:
  * Move the cursor with the RIGHT and DOWN buttons, or TILT your wrist.
  * Enter SWAP mode by pressing the UP button.
  * In SWAP mode, choose the direction to swap with the UP, DOWN, LEFT or RIGHT button, or TILT your wrist.
  * When not in SWAP mode, press the LEFT button to save and exit.

## Specials:
  * Match four rocks in a row to make a Pearl, which can match any colour of rock.
  * Match a rock in two directions to make Black Powder - careful, it's explosive.
  *Match five rocks in a row to blast that rock type.
